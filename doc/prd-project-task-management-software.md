### 1. Introduction

- **Background**: Organizations have needs for managing multiple projects in parallel, requiring unified management of projects and tasks, tracking progress, milestones, dependencies and risks, improving collaboration efficiency and delivery controllability.
- **Target Users**: Leaders/project managers, project members, PMO/operations support.
- **Product Vision**: Provide an integrated project task management platform that supports project decomposition, task assignment and collaboration, visual progress, automatic alerts and notifications, helping teams complete projects on time with high quality.

### 2. User Stories and Scenario Descriptions

- **As a leader/manager**, I can create projects, set names, departments, managers, planned start/end dates, milestones and dependencies; I can break down projects into tasks and assign them to members for clear progress.
- **As a member**, I can view assigned tasks, update progress and status, record actual completion time and duration, add notes, ensuring real-time information synchronization.
- **As a manager**, I can view overall progress, critical paths and milestone achievements in board/Gantt charts; when risks or delays may occur, I can receive automatic alerts and notify relevant members.
- **As PMO**, I can aggregate project status across departments, filter and export by department/manager/progress/completion rate dimensions for weekly reports and retrospectives.

### 3. Product Scope and Feature List (Scope & Features)

- **Project Management**
  - Create/edit/archive projects: project name, department, status, manager, members.
  - Planned time: planned start/end time, actual completion time; calculate duration and deviation.
  - Project attributes: completion rate (aggregated from tasks), milestones, notes.
  - Dependency management: set dependencies between projects or tasks, mark critical paths.
- **Task Management**
  - Task decomposition: leaders/managers break down projects into multiple tasks.
  - Assignment and collaboration: task managers and participants, support comments/attachments.
  - Progress and status: percentage progress, status (not started/in progress/blocked/completed).
  - Time recording: planned start/end, actual completion time, duration and deviation.
  - Dependencies: predecessor tasks and blocking display.
- **Visual Progress**
  - Gantt chart: planned vs actual comparison, critical path and milestone display.
  - Board: manage tasks by status lanes, support drag-and-drop status updates.
  - Statistical views: project completion rate, burn-down/burn-up charts, department/manager distribution.
- **Notifications and Alerts**
  - Conditional triggers: planned overdue, progress lag, dependency blocking, critical milestone risks.
  - Notification channels: in-app notifications, email (optional), IM Webhook (optional).
  - Audience scope: managers, task members, subscribers.
- **Search and Filtering**
  - Conditional filtering: project/department/status/manager/member/time range.
  - Export: CSV/Excel export of project and task lists (including key fields).
- **Permissions and Roles**
  - Roles: administrator, leader/project manager, regular member, read-only visitor.
  - Permissions: differentiated control for create/assign/edit/delete/view.

Out of scope (not in this phase): budget/cost management, external time tracking system integration, complex resource scheduling.

### 4. Product-Specific AI Requirements

#### 4.1 Model Requirements (Function, Performance Metrics)

- **Delay and Risk Alert**: Predict potential delays based on plans, actual progress, dependencies and historical deviations.
  - Performance target: Recall rate ≥ 0.75 for high-risk tasks, false positive rate ≤ 0.25.
- **Smart Reminder Rhythm**: Learn team response habits, optimize reminder timing and frequency, reduce disturbance.
  - Target: Notification click/processing conversion rate improvement ≥ 20%.
- Initially adopt rule + simple learning hybrid approach, gradually evolve to supervised learning models.

#### 4.2 Data Requirements (Source, Quantity, Quality, Annotation)

- **Source**: Project/task fields, operation logs (status changes/comments), historical delay records, dependency relationships, actual duration.
- **Quantity**: Minimum 6-12 months of project and task data as initial samples; rule-based approach during cold start period.
- **Quality**: Field completeness rate ≥ 95%, accurate timestamps; define strategies for outliers and missing values.
- **Annotation**: Use actual delay/blocking status as labels; automatically generated by system, manually spot-checked and corrected.

#### 4.3 Algorithm Boundaries and Interpretability

- Results provide key factor explanations: such as "predecessor task X delayed 2 days" "progress lag 20%".
- Limitations: No personal performance judgment, no biased individual labels.

#### 4.4 Evaluation Standards

- Alert effectiveness: Recall rate/precision/F1 metrics, notification conversion rate.
- User experience: False positive rate, reminder disturbance level (unsubscribe rate, mute rate).
- Business metrics: On-time delivery rate improvement, overdue project ratio reduction.

#### 4.5 Ethics and Compliance

- Data minimization and desensitization, role-based minimum privilege access.
- Compliance: Company security standards and local privacy regulations; traceable audit logs.

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements (Performance, Security, Availability, etc.)

- **Performance**:
  - List/board/Gantt first screen loading P95 ≤ 2.0s (1k task scale).
  - Batch export 10k rows within 30s (async export).
- **Availability**:
  - Availability ≥ 99.9%; key operations support failure retry and idempotency.
- **Security**:
  - Role permission control, operation audit, field-level access control (managers/members can see sensitive information).
  - Transmission/storage encryption, backup and recovery strategy (RPO 24h, RTO 4h).
- **Maintainability**:
  - Logging levels and alerts, error code standards, interface contract documentation.

### 6. Release Standards and Measurement Metrics

- **Functionality completeness**: Core functions in above scope available, permissions cover leaders/managers/members.
- **Quality threshold**: No P0/P1 defects in critical paths; regression tests pass; performance standards met.
- **Data and AI**: Rule-based alerts online, evaluation dashboard observable recall/false positives; comprehensive data tracking.
- **Documentation**: User manual, API documentation, operations manual complete.

### 7. Pending Items and Future Planning

- Third-party integration: Enterprise IM (such as Enterprise WeChat/Feishu), calendar, single sign-on.
- Advanced planning: OKR/goal alignment, cross-project resource load view, budget cost management.
- AI evolution: From rules → feature engineering + supervised learning → time series/graph models (dependency graphs).
